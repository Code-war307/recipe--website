Build a production-grade landing page for an AI-powered code editor with the following specifications:

1. Navbar

Modern structure, responsive.

Three sections:

Left: Logo and brand name.

Center: Navigation links – "Featured", "Contact".

Right: Buttons for "Sign Up" and "Login".

On scroll, navbar background should be transparent initially and change smoothly on scroll.

Navigation links should brighten on hover, show underline transition, and have slight scale/size effect.

2. Hero Section

Multi-section hero layout inspired by modern AI code editor landing pages.

Section 1:

Heading: Brand / app name (e.g., "AI-powered Code Editor").

CTA buttons: "Sign In" and "Sign Up".

Attractive hero image/illustration (optional: code editor interface or AI illustration).

Section 2:

Showcase features: real-time code suggestions, AI completions, multi-language support.

Add small animation effects on hover or scroll.

Section 3 (optional):

Testimonials, integrations, or secondary CTA.

Use Framer Motion for smooth animations and scroll effects.

3. Footer

Modern structure with multiple columns:

About / Company info

Navigation links

Social media icons

Minimalistic and visually balanced.

4. Color Palette

Use 4–5 modern AI-inspired colors. Example palette:

Primary: #5C6BC0 (deep indigo)

Secondary: #FF4081 (vibrant pink)

Accent: #00E676 (bright green)

Background: #F5F5F5 (light gray)

Text: #212121 (dark gray)

Define all colors as variables (CSS variables or SCSS) so that changes are reflected globally.

5. Animations & Interactions

Use Framer Motion for:

Smooth hero section scroll transitions.

Button hover animations.

Section fade-ins on scroll.

Links should have underline transition and scale effect on hover.

6. Code Requirements

Use React + Tailwind CSS (or plain CSS if preferred).

Fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

All colors, font sizes, spacing, and button styles should be easily configurable via variables or Tailwind config.

Clean, modular, and maintainable component structure: Navbar, HeroSection, Footer, FeatureCard, CTAButton.

Optional Enhancements

Animated hero background (e.g., gradient animation or subtle particle effect).

Sticky navbar with smooth fade effect.

Dark/light mode toggle.
